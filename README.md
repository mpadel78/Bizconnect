This was the project I did as Student Developer at College of Business at Southeastern Louisiana University. I created this web application that lets career Fair (Bizconnect) attendees find their companies of their choice. It was integrated into the mobile app which was built on Ionic platform. 

The link to mobile application is given here: https://appadvice.com/app/biz-connect/1363168868
